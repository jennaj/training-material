### Overview

- What is genome annotation?

- Tools for genome annotation

- The tool "Prokka"

---
### What is Annotation?

- Classifying and describing parts of the genome sequence

- Annotations are biological or other features on a genome, *e.g.*

    - a ribosome binding site: a biological feature

    - a sequence of TTTTTT: may/may not be biological but could be interesting

- We can name features by type and location, *e.g.* gene, pseudogene, repeat

- We can hypothesise functions, *e.g.* antioxidant activity

### First: assemble the genome

### Then: annotate

### How do we annotate? many different ways:

- sequence: does it match known sequences in databases?

- sequence structure: *e.g.* does it look like an exon (start and stop codons)?

- use other data: *e.g.* do lab experiments to investigate biological function
