Did you know we have a unique Single Cell Lab with all our single cell tools highlighted to make it easier to use on Galaxy? We recommend this site for all your single cell analysis needs, particularly for newer users.

The Single Cell Lab currently uses the main European Galaxy infrastructure and power, it's just organised better for users of particular analyses...like single cell!

Try it out! All your histories/workflows/logins from the general [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) will be there!
