When you are editing a workflow, there are a number of additional steps you can take to ensure that it is a Best Practice workflow and will be more reusable.

1. Open a workflow for editing
1. In the workflow menu bar, you'll find the {% icon galaxy-wf-options %} Workflow Options dropdown menu.
1. Click on it and select "Best Practices" from the dropdown menu.

1. This will take you to a new side panel, which allows you to investigate and correct any issues with your workflow.

Additionally several items already have green checks like the workflow defining creator information and a license.]({% link faqs/galaxy/images/best-practices2.png %})
